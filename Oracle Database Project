Oracle Database Project — Data Integration & SQL Analysis

Tools: Oracle Autonomous Database, SQL, Python (cx_Oracle), Google Colab

Skills demonstrated:

✔ Relational schema design
✔ Connecting to Oracle DB from Python
✔ Writing SQL queries (JOIN, GROUP BY, filtering)
✔ Data loading & manipulation
✔ Analytical SQL for business questions

This project demonstrates how to connect a Google Colab environment to an Oracle Autonomous Database, load data into relational tables, and perform analytical SQL queries.

The goal is to show a complete workflow:
	1.	Database setup
	2.	Table creation & schema
	3.	Data insertion
	4.	Querying the data
	5.	Business insights from SQL analysis

This project simulates a real analyst workflow using a cloud database environment.
