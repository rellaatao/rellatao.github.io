Insurance Loss Prediction & Claim Status Classification

Machine Learning & Feature Engineering for Risk Modeling

Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, SMOTE, SHAP
Techniques: Regression (LC & HALC), Classification (CS), Outlier control, Feature engineering, Capping, Cross-validation, One-Hot Encoding, SHAP interpretability

This project builds end-to-end predictive models for insurance loss cost (LC), historically adjusted loss cost (HALC), and claim status (CS) using a real-world-like insurance dataset.

It simulates a full analytics workflow used by pricing, underwriting, and risk modeling teams:
	1.	Data cleaning & outlier handling
	2.	Date parsing & 10+ engineered features
	3.	Pipeline-based preprocessing (numeric + categorical)
	4.	Regression models for LC & HALC
	5.	Classification models for claim status
	6.	Feature selection using L1, XGBoost, LightGBM
	7.	Model comparison using 5-fold CV RMSE / ROC-AUC
	8.	Model interpretability with SHAP
	9.	Final prediction generation for LC, HALC, and CS
